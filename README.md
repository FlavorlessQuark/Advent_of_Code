## Reminder to self

Windows files have CRLF file endings and must be converted via `dos2unix [filename]`
Else some surprises may occur while parsing.

Interestingly after learning python, I look at file parsing differently >.<

Need to Update aoc.h:

 - [ ] Dictionaries would be immensely useful
 - [ ] 1D, 2D, 3D, any D array allocation though I doubt I will need more than 2D
 - [ ] List len, append, prepend etc...
 - [ ] array append, prepend etc..

**Some problems need better or redone solutions**

Quick thoughts about things:

Maybe it's worth it making iterators? It's getting tiring to rwrite the same iterating loop. It's like living on a merry-go-round.
