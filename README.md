## About

Advent of Code (AoC) is a yearly coding contest spanning 25 days from December 1st to December 25th.

Each day sees a new two part problem being released at midnight. Participants try to solve the problems the fastest to get on the leaderboard.

## Language choice

Although it may not have been the original reason why I chose them, I am sticking to C and Python exclusively to solve these problems. 

**Python** is mainly used for the live event as it allows for faster coding (even though sometimes I would rather solve the problem in C). Problems solved this way aren't necessarily neat nor understandable, rather I hope to solve the problems as quickly and efficiently as I possibly can.

**C** is mainly used to train for robustness and readability of the programs. In those I will take my time and implement them in an elegant and easy to understandable, readable and clean fashion.
