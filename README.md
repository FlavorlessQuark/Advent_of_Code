## About


Advent of Code (AoC) is a yearly coding contest spanning 25 days from December 1st to December 25th.

Each day see a new two part problem being released at midnight. Participants try to solve the problems the fastest to get on the leaderboard.

Years fully solved :

Additionally , the C solutions are mostly using my own aoc.h header file which contains functions and macros that allow problems to be solved even faster.
