## Behold

Was simply iterating over string and making a new one everytime which was (expectedly) very slow.
So slow in fact that I wasn't able to get the second star...

This version uses regex and could potentially be two - three lines if it wasn't for readability.
I think it could be somewhat faster if I didn't "save" the string, but my slithery skills aren't quite there yet

Runs in:

real    0m5.015s
user    0m3.906s
sys     0m1.109s
