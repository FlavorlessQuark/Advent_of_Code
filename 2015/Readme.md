## The Path of the Snake:

Thou shan't be afraid to *import*

If 't be true thy mind hast hought of it, then there exists an *import*

To reacheth true und'rstanding is to comprehend [Comprehensions][0]

Thou shalt know that -1 is indeed a valid index...

When thou discovers that *xrange* is faster than *range* for thy looping purposes, then thou shall soon earn thy Scale of Speed

If thou art a member of the reputable **Lazy club** then thou may use and abuse of *lambda*

## Import todo

- [ ] Day01: To be redone using regex (import re)
- [ ] Day05: Surely this can be done with only one iteration...
- [ ] Day06: Did somebody say [Hash_Table, Blessed Tool of the SpeedSeeker] ?
- [ ] Day08: is written more like C. More slithery thinking is required
- [x] Day09: There has to be a way to do this with comprehensions. But then again `Beautiful is better than ugly, and simple is better than complex`, and I'm sure the comprehension would be fairly complex and ugly
- [ ] Day10: Need to replace int by str for part 2 (number gets too big)
- [x] Day15: xrange() is faster than range()...

- [ ] Day19: Part2 is tricky. Can't be done with a tree (probably can but would take forever) Probably need to work backwards from solution back to e, inverting key with replacement. The input has a pattern Rn..Y..Ar | Rn..Ar | or just random letters. The problem is solving it in a pythonic way...

## From knowledge import progress_report as pr

Comprehensions are perhaps the most useful things. They allow for a one time object allocation (instead of using, for example, repeated calls to append() which reallocates the object everytime). Though they must be kept relatively simple for readibility purposes...

I'm quite satisfied of my comprehensions so far, they are getting more complex but more straightforward.

Learned about enumerate, useful when making comprehensions out of file line numbers. Would be useful for Aunt Sue

Lambda expressions are something I have yet to utilize properly. I'm not sure why they would be used over regular functions. given that they are the same thing...

I should learn to use map(), though I have yet to find a use for it

### This is Sadly only for [python3][2] :(
Dictionaries can be considered a set and can have anything as a key... even another dictionary

Just like mathematical sets, union, interesections and differences can be performed... See **[Set][1]**

However, I am not sure why one would use a |= b instead of a.update(b) (a and b both being dictionaries)

Xrange is not supported on python 3
