Thou shan't be afraid to *import*
If 't be true thy mind hast hought of it, then there exists an *import*
To reacheth true und'rstanding is to comprehend [Comprehensions][0]


## Scales to be earned:

 - [ ] SCale of the Sun:
	- [ ] Day01: To be redone using regex (import re)

 - [ ] Scale of Speed:
	- [ ] Day05: Surely this can be done with only one iteration...
	- [ ] Day06: Did somebody say [Hash_Table, Blessed Tool of the SpeedSeeker] ?
	- [ ] Day10: Need to replace in by str for part 2 (number gets too big)

 - [ ] Scale of the Moon:
 	- [ ] Day08: is written more like C. More slithery thinking is required. Perhaps a more object oriented approach.
	- [x] Day09: There has to be a way to do this with comprehensions. But then again `Beautiful is better than ugly, and simple is better than complex`, and I'm sure the comprehension would be fairly complex and ugly
 - [ ] Scale of the Quetzacoatl:
 		A visualizer for everything!
