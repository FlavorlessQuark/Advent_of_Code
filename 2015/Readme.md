	- [ ] Day06: Did somebody say [Hash_Table, Blessed Tool of the SpeedSeeker] ?

	- [ ] Day09: There has to be a way to do this with comprehensions. But then again `Beautiful is better than ugly, and simple is better than complex`, and I'm sure the comprehension would be fairly complex and ugly
 - [ ] Scale of the Quetzacoatl:
