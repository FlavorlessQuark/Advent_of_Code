I don't think my solution is good enough yet. I will come back to this once I have a better way to solve this.

At the moment, my solution is similar to that of day_17 where, new coordinates are added to the list of steps they are not already present within it. This gives the shortest path.

However, half of this problem involves a tree. I am not yet sure in which way it would be best to combine the two.
