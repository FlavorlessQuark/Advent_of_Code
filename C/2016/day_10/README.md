This solution is absolutetly awful

It simulates the entire list of instructions.
A better approach would be to initialize all the bots that can be initialized and then run the instructions only if the bot does have two chips to give.

As of now the program just reads the input over and over again until every step is processed.

I'm sure it can be done recursively too.
I refuse to write part with this mesy code. Come back later
