if a is even, then the resulting out is 1, else it is 0

It is a matter of understanding the relationship between the final number and the input.
In theory then all one needs to do is to find howthe input affects itself, and solve it in such a way that the resulting number has opposite "oddness" to the starting number.
I think these numbers would be part of a particular set and observe a disctint pattern.

This could also be solved with brute force if we define that, after an arbitrary number of repetitions, the input number is valid.
