Part 1 :
	Got the star because of some random adjustment. While I believe the logic is mostly correct, there is something missing...
	The output I get is nearly 3 times the actual answer. There must be an off by one error somewhere.
Part 2:
	Seems to be some pathfinding algorithm. It's hard to think about one that would run in a decent amount of time.
	It seems though that by making some assumptions, on can make the algorithm not take an entire lifetime...
	SHould implement this later
