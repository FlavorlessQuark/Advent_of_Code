# Gotta go fast

## Reminder to self

Windows files have CRLF file endings and must be converted via `dos2unix [filename]`
Else some surprises may occur while parsing.

Interestingly after learning python, I look at file parsing differently >.<

Need to Update aoc.h:

 - [ ] _sizeof / typeof/ inline vs extern vs static / variadic macros / tokenization
 - [ ] byte manipulatin for  faster count / swap / min-max
 - [ ] Swap macro, because that's simple and long overdue using the above ^
 - [ ] Map macro(takes an iterable and a function that does something with the members of the iterable), iterable should be either a list or an array;
 - [ ] List Merge sort that can merge no matter what the data type is (macro redirect to function) and based on a function to be mapped.
 - [ ] More parsing functions, general by line and word.
 - [ ] Array to list by delimiter and vice versa
 - [ ] Dictionaries would be immensely useful
 - [ ] 1D, 2D, 3D, any D array allocation though I doubt I will need more than 2D
 - [ ] Stack memory allocation with alloca and _malloca.
 - [ ] List len, append, prepend etc...
 - [ ] array append, prepend etc..
**Some problems need better or redone solutions**
