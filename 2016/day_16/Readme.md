I was thinking it would be possible to create some new type with 272 bits...
I'm not sure how useful it would be, but it would be interesting to try regardless

p1 gives a result almost instantly while part 2 doesnt give anything even after an hour.
Not sure if code or VM.
There is a memory allocation that might be the problem in strrev. Something something macro magic? I had seen a few SWAP macros on stackoverflow, I might try to work out something similar. Maybe without the extra memory allocation, it will actually run faster
